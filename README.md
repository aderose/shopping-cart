# Shopping Cart

A fake Champagne store. This project was used to solidify understanding of React's useState, useEffect and Router.

There are a total of four routes:

- Home page
- Shop page
- About page
- Cart page

A user can select products from the Shop page, these products will then be added the users cart, where the user can make further adjustments to the quantity of the products they have selected.

[See the implementation here](https://aderose.github.io/shopping-cart/)
